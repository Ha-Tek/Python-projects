    "Note that we use the CP-SAT solver from the OR-Tools library and create Boolean variables using NewBoolVar and integer variables using NewIntVar.

    "The code uses the CP-SAT solver from the OR-Tools library to solve a graph theory problem. The problem is to find a minimum weight spanning tree in an undirected graph with 21 nodes, where the degree of each node is 5 except for the last node, which has a degree of 6.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Y dictionary is used to represent auxiliary variables that help to ensure that the selected edges form a tree. For each pair of nodes (i, j) and each node k that is not i or j, the code creates a new Boolean variable Y[(i, j, k)] and adds it to the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "The final set of constraints ensure that the selected edges do not form cycles. For each pair of nodes (i, j) and each node k that is not i or j, the code adds two new constraints to the model. The first constraint specifies that if Y[(i, j, k)] is true, then either X[(i, k)] or X[(k, i)] must also be true, and the second constraint specifies that if Y[(i, j, k)] is true, then either X[(j, k)] or X[(k, j)] must also be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code then creates a CP-SAT solver object called solver, sets a solver parameter to disable logging of the search progress, and calls the Solve method of the solver object to solve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the solver returns an optimal solution, the code extracts the values of the X and Y variables and creates a set of edges EDGES that correspond to the selected edges in the graph. Finally, the code prints the values of X, Y, and EDGES."
