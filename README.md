# Python-projects

# 1. Python with GUROBI to solve an integer linear programming problem  from the paper: 
Szádoczki, Z., Bozóki, S., & Tekile, H. A. (2022). Filling in pattern designs for incomplete pairwise comparison matrices:(quasi-) regular graphs with minimal diameter. Omega, 107, 102557.

a. The problem has 5082 variables, 9493 constraints, and 1 objective function (when n=22)
b. The problem has 4410 variables, 8211 constraints, and 1 objective function (when n=21)

# 2.  Machine Learning Classification Algorithms

In this project, you will complete a notebook where you will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.
You load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

- Jaccard index
- F1-score
- LogLoass
